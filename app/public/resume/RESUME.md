### Experience

#### Software Engineer III @ Rackspace (formerly Onica) [**May 2019 - Present**]

- Responsible for Research and Development on various cloud based technologies towards the creation of tools for our development teams.
- Led the charge on the creation of 'Onica Start', a GUI based application that communizes the various open source and internal tool-sets offered by Onica.
- Worked closely with Operations teams to help define and solidify Site Reliability Engineering practices.

#### Senior Engineer @ Logikcull [**May 2018 - May 2019**]

- Led the effort to refactor the continuous integration and deployment pipeline and testing strategy surrounding deployments. Test suite previously took anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to run, often with variability in passing results. That time was reduced to an average of 4 minutes while nullifying the "flappy" tests after refactor. This greatly increased deployment velocity of the team.
- Led the effort and guided the team in converting the application from a monolith to multiple micro-services. Utilizing the Serverless framework services were created and planned around Kinesis which acted as a publish-subscribe endpoint for various event streams within the application suite. As new events were published to Kinesis the subscribing services would consume the event and perform any functionality on that data in real time. Following this strategy allowed for pieces to be segmented from the monolith into various single focus entities creating greater modularity and a better development experience.
- Guided and mentored other team developers as the company began embracing a fundamentally agile process for handling projects. Previously the organization had leaned towards waterfall approaches that did not allow for the type of scalability required for the growth of the company.

#### Lab Services Engineer @ Linux Academy [**August 2017 - Present**]

- Responsible for rearchitecting and redesigning a custom expectation testing
  library used to verify student assessment submissions of cloud platform
  environments (AWS, Azure, OpenStack, ect.). Increased processing performance
  by over 300% while providing more meaningful error handling, return values,
  and scalability avenues for future integrations.
- Was able to identify productivity enhancements to our pipelines and workflows
  which enabled the team to complete an average of 150% more assigned tasks in
  the same period of time allowed (48 hours). This allowed the content
  development team to keep up with student demand of new courses while allowing
  Lab Services to develop new tools and processes to increase efficiency and
  fortify performance of our software offerings.
- Made recommendations on utilizing development tools such as Rollbar, Rubocop,
  and Pry to ensure the integrity of our product suite. Through recommendations
  and support was able to standardize these tools through the company and
  accurately identify several production bugs that were not previously known.

#### Principal Software Engineer @ The Nerdery [**December 2012 - August 2017**]

- Previously Senior Software Engineer & Software Engineer
- Lead over 50 successful projects with an average budget utilization percentage
  of 93.02%. Pinpointing efficiencies in the projects allowed customers to
  utilize surplus resources for extended feature sets, ultimately getting them
  more in line with their overall business goals. Worked with high profile
  portfolio engagements such as Pepsi Co / Frito Lay, Hasbro, Marriot, Purina,
  Medtronic, Blizzard Entertainment, Surly Brewing Company, The
  Marketing Arm, BBDO, Grey New York, and many more.
- Defined the offering of Ruby on Rails at the company. Through leadership and
  guidance was able to provide the sales team with the necessary tools to
  effectively address Ruby on Rails based leads and obtain client portfolios
  that otherwise would have proved beyond The Nerdery’s reach.
- Created a framework allowing custom WordPress projects to be completed in
  comparable time frames to that of the third party compilation versions. This
  framework bridged the gap between the CMS and Custom PHP Application
  development teams.
- Entrusted with mentoring team members in the use of build tools and bleeding
  edge technologies as well as various best practice approaches to HTML, CSS,
  JavaScript, WordPress, PHP, Ruby/Rails and technical documentation.

#### Lead Web Developer @ Faster Solutions, Inc. [**January 2012 - December 2012**]

- Previously Web Designer/Developer
- Reduced project timelines by an average of 21% by streamlining the build
  process for the company. This involved filtering most of our clientele into a
  WordPress based system and altering company processes to ensure workflows were
  being executed with minimal overhead.
- Shifted the build process from .NET to WordPress due to the more consistent
  point of entry. This increased the active client capacity the company could
  support at any given time.
- Built trust with clients through transparency and successful solutions. This
  trust lead to 4 additional projects allowing for company expansion.

#### Senior Web Developer @ 50 Below [**December 2009 - November 2011**]

- Previously Web Developer, Site Maintenance Lead & Site Maintenance Specialist
- Facilitated consistent offerings for our clients by developing 53 articles of
  formal procedural documentation used by the company for training and
  development. Formalizing the documentation in this manner allowed for easier
  job ramp-in and reduced hands-on mentorship requirements.
- Created custom modules to meet customer's requests considered out of scope
  from the normal factory line procedures of the company. Created departmental
  tool sets to increase developer efficiency within the department.
- Ensured customer satisfaction and continued contracts by increasing the site
  maintenance team’s efficiency 36.8% and corresponding task turnaround time by
  13.4% through employee mentorship and guidance.
