                Responsible for Research and Development on various cloud based
                technologies to assist in the creation of tools for our
                development teams. This often required pivoting between many
                different languages, frameworks, and libraries to produce the
                required project outcome.

                allowing for the automated deployment of private static sites
                backed by a Cognito authorizer. This allowed our development
                teams to quickly and easily spin-up development sites that were
                secured by the clients specific single sign-on service without
                the need for extensive configuration and planning. This effort

                Led the development effort for "Vend-r", an internal web

                accounts and enforce authorization requirements around Role
                assumption. This allowed the organization to closesly monitor
                the usage of AWS resources, quickly move employees from one
                authority group to another, and course correct any over spending

              <li>
                Led the effort to refactor the continuous integration and
                deployment pipeline and testing strategy surrounding
                deployments. Test suite previously took anywhere from 30 to 45
                minutes to run often with variability in passing results. That
                time was reduced to an average of 4 minutes while nullifying the
                "flappy" tests after refactor. This greatly increased deployment
                velocity of the team.
              </li>

              <li>
                Led the effort and guided the team in converting the application
                from a monolith to multiple micro-services. Utilizing the
                Serverless framework services were created and planned around
                Kinesis which acted as a publish-subscribe endpoint for various
                event streams within the application suite. As new events were
                published to Kinesis the subscribing services would consume the
                event and perform any functionality on that data in real time.
                Following this strategy allowed for pieces to be segmented from
                the monolith into various single focus entities creating greater
                modularity and a better development experience.

              <li>
                Guided and mentored other team developers as the company began
                embracing a fundamentally agile process for handling projects.
                Previously the organization had leaned towards waterfall
                approaches that did not allow for the type of scalability
                required for the growth of the company.

                submissions of cloud platform environments (AWS, Azure,

                Was able to identify productivity enhancements to our pipelines

                150% more assigned tasks in the same period of time allowed (48
                hours). This allowed the content development team to keep up

                extended feature sets, ultimately getting them more in line with
                their overall business goals. Worked with high profile portfolio

                Reduced project timelines by an average of 21% by streamlining

              <li>
                Shifted the build process from .NET to WordPress due to the more
